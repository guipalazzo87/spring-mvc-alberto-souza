# spring-mvc-alberto-souza

## Description

This project is a simple example of a Spring MVC application.
It follows the book "Spring MVC Domine o principal framework web Java" by Alberto Souza.

I've tried to keep the code as close as possible to the book, but I've made some changes to the code to make it work with the latest version of Spring.


## Installation

Deploy the war file in a servlet container like Tomcat or Jetty.

## Usage

After building the war file, deploy in a Servlet Container and access the URL http://localhost:8080/springmvc/

You should see a simple form with a few fields to fill in. After filling in the form and clicking on the "Enviar" button, you should see a message with the values you filled in the form.
